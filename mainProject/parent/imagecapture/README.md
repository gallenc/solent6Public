## example message handler microservice

This service is provided to help build a JMS service which runs in a docker container

## Packaging

The parent project contains the following modules

### imagecaptureexampleparent

parent project with default and packageAsDocker profile. 

### imagecapture-service

Contains the example code which runs in a spring application context

### imagecapture-assembly

Contains a main class and a one jar maven project to package the app

The assembly uses one-jar to package all of the dependencies as a single executable jar file
The packaged app can be run from imagecaptureexampleparent using 
(activemq must be running)
```
 java "-DapplicationPropertiesFile=.\assembly\target\classes\system.properties" -jar .\assembly\target\imagecapture-assembly-onejar.jar 
```

### imagecapture-docker

Packages the project as a docker file. 
To build the docker image from the parent project use
```
 mvn clean install -P packageAsDocker
```

once you have packaged the docker image you can run it directly using 

```
docker run imagecapture:latest
```

or  as a deamon

```
docker run -d  imagecapture:latest
```

to see the container daemon image name use
```
docker ps
```
output will be like
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                   COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                NAMES
